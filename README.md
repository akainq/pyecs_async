# PyECSAsync

## Entity Component System Implementation for Python with Asyncio

PyECSAsync is a modern, robust implementation of the Entity Component System (ECS) pattern, designed specifically for Python and enhanced with the power of asyncio for efficient asynchronous operations. This library aims to provide a flexible and scalable approach to game development and other simulation systems, leveraging the simplicity of Python and the efficiency of asynchronous programming.

### Features

- **Asynchronous by Design**: Built from the ground up to support asyncio, enabling non-blocking and concurrent operations.
- **Flexible Entity Management**: Easily create, modify, and manage entities.
- **Dynamic Component System**: Attach, detach, or modify components at runtime with minimal overhead.
- **Efficient System Execution**: Systems in PyECSAsync are designed for performance, handling entity and component processing swiftly.
- **Pythonic and Easy to Use**: Intuitive API that fits well within the Python ecosystem.

### Installation

To install PyECSAsync, simply use pip:

```bash
pip install pyecs-async
